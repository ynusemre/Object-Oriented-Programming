In my homework:

At the beginning of the program, first of all, I ask the user what kind of game they want. 4 They can play the game in variable type (Vector, 1D Array, Deque Template, Vector Template). The user selects one of the 4 and a game is played. Then the menu is presented to the user again. Then he chooses from 4 of them and the second game is played. When the two games are finished, it is checked whether the game boards are equal. The program can easily compare different game types.

I use the operator () operation to print the moves made by the computer, it throws an error message in invalid cases.

I use the isValid () global function when I load a game from any file. If there is an invalid status in the loaded game, the game is terminated. If the game loaded from the file is a valid game, the game is resumed.

I put a txt file into the zip that contains one invalid game state so that you can check the isValid () global function.And you can load this game in any game (with LOAD game1.txt).The game will end and will not continue as the game state is invalid.

I did my upcasting and downcasting operations in main.
