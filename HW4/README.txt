In my homework:

There is a problem in homework only playing multiple games at the same time.

Since I cannot make the situation that I cannot play games at the same time, I play two games to the user instead and compare these two games and in the first game, if there are more cells marked, I did a function that returns true.


but this problem does not valid for the homework 4.

The code meets all the requirements for homework 4.
