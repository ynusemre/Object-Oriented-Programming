Problems in my homework:

There is a problem in homework only at the end of the game.
For example, it is necessary from top to bottom to complete the X corners.I check all lines. If there is at least one X in all rows, the player wins. But if there is an X in all rows and they are not connected to each other, the game should not be over. The user wins the game even if he does not win the game because I do it according to having at least one X in all rows.This happens when the other user puts Z on the game board. Of course, the columns are controlled at that time.
